Schematics that are old but work very well in the 21st century with Arduino and DIY stuff
 
Schematic nr. 1:  H bridge for DC motor control with relays

H bridge for DC motor control with relays is very useful when the cheap variants modules based on  L298P and L298N don't complete your needs for driving motors.
Relays are old components and do not have high switching speed but still for basic control they do their job well.
